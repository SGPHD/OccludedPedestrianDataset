# Occluded Pedestrian Dataset

Partially Occluded Pedestrian Dataset used in ["Replacing the Human Driver: An Objective Benchmark for Occluded Pedestrian Detection"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04812) Gilroy _et al_ 2023. 



<img title="Dataset_Sample" src="images/DatasetSample.png"/> 


This dataset contains 820 person instances in 724 images for the characterization of detection model performance for partially occluded pedestrians. Pedestrian instances are occluded by a diverse mix of objects across a range of occlusion levels from 0 to 99% occluded.

Images are annotated using the objective occlusion level annotation method described in [An objective method for pedestrian occlusion level classification](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865522003270) Gilroy _et al_ 2022.

Annotation files are in COCO format.
